# Hi, I'm Ibrahim Salah

I'm an AI Engineer from Egypt, deeply interested in **speech technologies**, especially **Arabic Text-to-Speech (TTS)** and **Speech-to-Text (STT)** systems. I enjoy building end-to-end AI pipelines that bring research ideas to life — from training models to deploying real applications.

## My Focus Areas

### Speech Processing
- Trained several **Arabic TTS and STT systems**, working on pronunciation, dialect handling, and syllable-to-word generation.
- Investigating methods to improve **naturalness** and **robustness** in Arabic speech synthesis and recognition.

### Computer Vision
- Developed intelligent systems for **human activity recognition**, **sign language**, and **sports video understanding** 

### NLP & Multimodal AI
- Explored language modeling, dialect adaptation.
